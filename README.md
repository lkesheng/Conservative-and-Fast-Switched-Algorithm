It used to work in linux，I adjusted it to work in windows.

Using method:
turn on src folder，find bin folder.
turn on bin folder,  find Release folder. 
you can editor the test.d .This is a text which stores the information of one graph, just  replace it with you graph.
Then turn on 'cmd' in this folder, type in 'RUN.exe test.d', you will get the  Optimum Cycle Ratio .
